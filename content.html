<p>Hi, as you might have guessed, I'm Brad Harman (not the Australian baseball player, sorry). I grew up in south-eastern PA,
    went to CAL U in southwestern PA, and now I've settled in to south central PA. I guess you could say I'm a bit of a world
    traveller. (Pause for laughter). Anyway, I've been making media for the last decade, ever since I took audio and video
    courses in high school. Web developemnt is a recent skill I picked up, and one I'm eager to continue learning. </p>


<p>I have a degree in Commercial Music Technology, which is just a fancy way of saying I know my way around a microphone or
    a mixing board. I have done some interview style recording for use in podcasts, as well as a variety of music recordings
    from my time in college:</p>

<p>This is a sample of a recording I did for one half of a remote interview done for the
    <a href="http://villainishpodcast.com/" target="_blank"> Villain-ish Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked as a production assistant for a mostly video oriented company for the past 2 years. I am comfortable with all
    aspects of video production, from shooting and lighting, to editing and post production. I am most familiar with editing
    in Adobe Premiere Pro, but started by using Final Cut Pro. I also have a working knowledge of Adobe After Effects, Photoshop,
    and Illustrator.</p>

<p>This is a video that I did all the technical work on, including: lighting, audio, and cameras. The finished video was edited
    and directed by
    <a href="https://www.musser.cc/" target="_blank">Jerry King Musser</a> for the Bravo Group.

<p>Here's a fun fact: A year ago, I didn't know what Bootstrap or jQuery were. Now, I've written my own site that utilizes both. I started tinkering with
    HTML and CSS in college. I knew that having a website was going to be vital to career searching after college, so I bought this domain, and grabbed a 
    template that I tweaked just to host a portfolio.

<p>
    Now I'm serious about Web Development. I spent 6 months completing the Front End Web Development Certificate through <a href="freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>
    It took the basic HTML and CSS knowledge I had and added Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and some elements of UI design to it. You can see the example projects I worked on 
    by clicking on the codepen link at the bottom of the page. As I've already said, this whole site was written by me. No template tweaking, no site building service like Squarespace. 
    Just hard work and determination. And boy does it feel good.
