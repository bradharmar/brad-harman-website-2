                            web developments skills I acquired while completing my Front End Web Development Certificate

                            Hi, as you might have guessed, I'm Brad Harman (not the Australian baseball player, sorry). I grew up in south-eastern PA,
                            went to CAL U in south-western PA, and now I've settled in to south-central PA. I guess you could
                            say I'm a bit of a world traveller. (Pause for laughter). Anyway, I've been making media for
                            the last decade, ever since I took audio and video courses in high school. Web developemnt is
                            a recent skill I picked up, and one I'm eager to continue learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>I have a degree in Commercial Music Technology, which is just a fancy way of saying I know my way
                            around a microphone or a mixing board. I have done some interview style recording for use in
                            podcasts, as well as a variety of music recordings from my time in college:</p>

                        <p>This is a sample of a recording I did for one half of a remote interview done for the
                            <a href="http://villainishpodcast.com/" target="_blank"> Villain-ish Podcast</a>.</p>

                        <p>I have worked as a production assistant for a mostly video oriented company for the past 2 years.
                            I am comfortable with all aspects of video production, from shooting and lighting, to editing
                            and post production. I am most familiar with editing in Adobe Premiere Pro, but started by using
                            Final Cut Pro. I also have a working knowledge of Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

                        <p>This is a video that I did all the technical work on, including: lighting, audio, and cameras. The
                            finished video was edited and directed by
                            <a href="https://www.musser.cc/" target="_blank">Jerry King Musser</a> for the Bravo Group.

                        <p>Here's a fun fact: A year ago, I didn't know what Bootstrap or jQuery were. Now, I've written my
                            own site that utilizes both. I started tinkering with HTML and CSS in college. I knew that having
                            a website was going to be vital to career searching after college, so I bought this domain, and
                            grabbed a template that I tweaked just to host a portfolio.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, I'm serious about Web Development. I spent 6 months completing the Front End Web Development Certificate through
                            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>
                            It took the basic HTML and CSS knowledge I had and added Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and some elements of UI design to
                            it. You can see the example projects I worked on by clicking on the codepen link at the bottom
                            of the page. As I've already said, this whole front end was written by me. No template tweaking,
                            no site building service like Squarespace; just hard work and determination, and boy does it
                            feel good.
