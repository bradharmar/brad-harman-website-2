About -
<p>Hi, as you might have guessed, I'm Brad Harman (not the Australian baseball player, sorry). I grew up in south-eastern PA, went to CAL U in southwestern PA,
and now I've settled in to south central PA. I guess you could say I'm a bit of a world traveler. (Pause for laughter). Anyway, I've been making media for the
last decade, ever since I took audio and video courses in high school. Web developemnt is a recent skill I picked up, and one I'm eager to continue learning. </p>


Audio -
<p>I have a degree in Commercial Music Technology. Which is just a fancy way of saying I know my way around a microphone or a mixing board. I have done some
interview style recording for use in podcasts, as well as a variety of music recordings from my time in college:</p>

Video -
I have worked as a production assistant for a mostly video oriented company for the past 2 years. I am comfortable with all aspects of video production, from
shooting and lighting, to editing and post production. I am most familiar with editing in Adobe Premiere Pro, but started by using Final Cut Pro. I also have
a working knowledge of Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

This is a video that I did all the technical work on, including: lighting, audio, and cameras. The finished video was edited and directed by Jerry King Musser for the Bravo Group.
